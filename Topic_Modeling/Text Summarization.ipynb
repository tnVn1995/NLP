' the March Hare will be much the most interesting , and perhaps as this is May it won ' t be raving mad -- at least not so mad as it was in March .'\",\n 'As she said this , she looked up , and there was the Cat again , sitting on a branch of a tree .',\n \"' Did you say pig , or fig ?'\",\n 'said the Cat .',\n \"' I said pig ,' replied Alice ;

' but a grin without a cat !\",\n \"It ' s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life !'\",\n 'She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur .',\n \"It was so large a house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself ' Suppose it should be raving mad after all !\",\n \"I almost wish I ' d gone to see the Hatter instead !'\",\n 'CHAPTER VII .',\n 'A Mad Tea - Party',\n 'There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it : a Dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep , and the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it , and talking over its head .',\n \"' Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse ,' thought Alice ; ' only , as it ' s asleep , I suppose it doesn ' t mind .'\",\n \"The table was a large one , but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it : ' No room !\",\n \"No room !'\",\n 'they cried out when they saw Alice coming .',\n \"' There ' s PLENTY of room !'\",\n 'said Alice indignantly , and she sat down in a large arm - chair at one end of the table .',\n \"' Have some wine ,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone .\",\n 'Alice looked all round the table , but there was nothing on it but tea .',\n \"' I don ' t see any wine ,' she remarked .\",\n \"' There isn ' t any ,' said the March Hare .\",\n \"' Then it wasn ' t very civil of you to offer it ,' said Alice angrily .\",\n \"' It wasn ' t very civil of you to sit down without being invited ,' said the March Hare .\",\n \"' I didn ' t know it was YOUR table ,' said Alice ; ' it ' s laid for a great many more than three .'\",\n \"' Your hair wants cutting ,' said the Hatter .\",\n 'He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech .',\n \"' You should learn not to make personal remarks ,' Alice said with some severity ; ' it ' s very rude .'\",\n \"The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this ; but all he SAID was , ' Why is a raven like a writing - desk ?'\",\n \"' Come , we shall have some fun now !'\",\n 'thought Alice .',\n \"' I ' m glad they ' ve begun asking riddles .-- I believe I can guess that ,' she added aloud .\",\n \"' Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ?'\",\n 'said the March Hare .',\n \"' Exactly so ,' said Alice .\",\n \"' Then you should say what you mean ,' the March Hare went on .\",\n \"' I do ,' Alice hastily replied ; ' at least -- at least I mean what I say -- that ' s the same thing , you know .'\",\n \"' Not the same thing a bit !'\",\n 'said the Hatter .',\n '\\' You might just as well say that \" I see what I eat \" is the same thing as \" I eat what I see \"!\\'',\n '\\' You might just as well say ,\\' added the March Hare , \\' that \" I like what I get \" is the same thing as \" I get what I like \"!\\'',\n '\\' You might just as well say ,\\' added the Dormouse , who seemed to be talking in his sleep , \\' that \" I breathe when I sleep \" is the same thing as \" I sleep when I breathe \"!\\'',\n \"' It IS the same thing with you ,' said the Hatter , and here the conversation dropped , and the party sat silent for a minute , while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing - desks , which wasn ' t much .\",\n 'The Hatter was the first to break the silence .',\n \"' What day of the month is it ?'\",\n 'he said , turning to Alice : he had taken his watch out of his pocket , and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then , and holding it to his ear .',\n \"Alice considered a little , and then said ' The fourth .'\",\n \"' Two days wrong !'\",\n 'sighed the Hatter .',\n \"' I told you butter wouldn ' t suit the works !'\",\n 'he added looking angrily at the March Hare .',\n \"' It was the BEST butter ,' the March Hare meekly replied .\",\n \"' Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well ,' the Hatter grumbled : ' you shouldn ' t have put it in with the bread - knife .'\",\n \"The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily : then he dipped it into his cup of tea , and looked at it again : but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark , ' It was the BEST butter , you know .'\",\n 'Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity .',\n \"' What a funny watch !'\",\n 'she remarked .',\n \"' It tells the day of the month , and doesn ' t tell what o ' clock it is !'\",\n \"' Why should it ?'\",\n 'muttered the Hatter .',\n \"' Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is ?'\",\n \"' Of course not ,' Alice replied very readily : ' but that ' s because it stays the same year for such a long time together .'\",\n \"' Which is just the case with MINE ,' said the Hatter .\",\n 'Alice felt dreadfully puzzled .',\n \"The Hatter ' s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it , and yet it was certainly English .\",\n \"' I don ' t quite understand you ,' she said , as politely as she could .\",\n \"' The Dormouse is asleep again ,' said the Hatter , and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose .\",\n \"The Dormouse shook its head impatiently , and said , without opening its eyes , ' Of course , of course ;

these were all shaped like the three gardeners , oblong and flat , with their hands and feet at the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds , and walked two and two , as the soldiers did .',\n 'After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them , and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented with hearts .',\n 'Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit : it was talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was said , and went by without noticing her .',\n \"Then followed the Knave of Hearts , carrying the King ' s crown on a crimson velvet cushion ; and , last of all this grand procession , came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS .\",\n \"Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners , but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ; ' and besides , what would be the use of a procession ,' thought she , ' if people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they couldn ' t see it ?'\",\n 'So she stood still where she was , and waited .',\n \"When the procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked at her , and the Queen said severely ' Who is this ?'\",\n 'She said it to the Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply .',\n \"' Idiot !'\",\n \"said the Queen , tossing her head impatiently ; and , turning to Alice , she went on , ' What ' s your name , child ?'\",\n \"' My name is Alice , so please your Majesty ,' said Alice very politely ; but she added , to herself , ' Why , they ' re only a pack of cards , after all .\",\n \"I needn ' t be afraid of them !'\",\n \"' And who are THESE ?'\",\n 'said the Queen , pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree ;
